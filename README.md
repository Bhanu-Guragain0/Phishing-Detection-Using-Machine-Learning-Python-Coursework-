## Introduction
This program utilizes machine learning algorithms, specifically Logistic Regression, to analyze email content and identify potential phishing attempts. It preprocesses email data, trains a predictive model, and evaluates its accuracy. Users can input email texts to check for phishing in real-time.

## System Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: pandas, scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install Python 3.x if not already installed.
3. Install the required Python libraries:
   
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
   

## Usage
1. Prepare a phishing email dataset in CSV format.
2. Update the "file_path" variable in the code to point to your dataset.
3. Run the program:
   
   python coursework.py
   
4. Follow the instructions to input email texts and check for phishing.
